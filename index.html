        <h2>Our app allows YOU to match with local people and make new friends!</h2>
        <p>This app is intended to solve a connectivity problem that technology has created. As technology advances, the world is more connected, but connectivity in the physical world is dwindling. Our goal is to create a social media platform that focuses on bringing back close and real friendships. We want for users to move away from sharing highlights to a large group of people to move out into the real world and experiencing common joys with one another.</p>
