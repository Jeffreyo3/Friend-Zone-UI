Proposal

- What problem does your app solve?
	Our app allows us to match with locals to make new friends. 
- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
	The app provides a platform to find people who share your common interests by asking the user questions. Users can opt to “match” or “move on”. The app is directed at people who want to find friends and removes the awkwardness of other apps that are used to initiate dating relationships.
- What is the mission statement?
	This app is intended to solve a connectivity problem that technology has created. As technology advances, the world is more connected, but connectivity in the physical world is dwindling. Our goal is to create a social media platform that focuses on bringing back close and real friendships. We want for users to move away from sharing highlights to a large group of people to move out into the real world and experiencing common joys with one another.
Features

- What features are required for your minimum viable product?
	Upon account creation, a user will be guided through the process of selecting a bunch of questions to survey as many of their interests as possible. As a user I want to be able to see people using friend finder to determine whether or not I'd like to request a match. I will be presented with another user, and I can select "Match/Move on". Clicking "match" sends a message to that particular user to see who's requested matches. As a user I can see a page of users who've requested my match and either reciprocate with a "match or move on". Once matched, users can start to chat one with another and coordinate times/places to meet up to casually make new friends.
- What features may you wish to put in a future release?
Geolocation - So users can find friends even closer.
Timeline - Share photos/videos from recent fun hangouts to extend an open invitation for new users in the area to join during the next event.
Personality Type - Allow users to share their personality type.
- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?
Meetup - Encourages group meetups for events, but does not facilitate individual friendships.
Tinder - Encourages relationships/romantic interest, but not purely platonic friendships.
Facebook - Facebook has groups, pages, and events, but does not focus on meeting new friends.
Frameworks - Libraries

- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?
	React
- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?
	No
- Are you required to pay to use the API?
	No
- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)
	No
For Data Scientists


- Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1. 
- You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.
- Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)
- A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app

Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.
Working Adults - Professionals who work many hours and need to be efficient with free time.
Introverts - May have trouble approaching strangers even in events focused on networking/match-making. The app should allow for them to connect before the initial meeting.
People in new cities - College students, foreign exchange students, work transfers, military vets, truck drivers, etc. The app will help them create a friendship foundation to create some familiarity in a new and strange place.
- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?
“I want to use it!!”
People wish they could find someone to hangout with, but have a hard time finding someone to join.
- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?
Not at this time, but we intend to :)

Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
